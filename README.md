# Machine-Learning-Based-Monitoring-of-Sleepiness-of-the-Driver
This is the group project develop by three member of the project group. It uses various machine learning algorithms for detecting the drowsiness of the driver by detecting the frequency of blinking of driver. In this project we uses OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy and Keras.
